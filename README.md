Project at "Parallel Systems" lecture. <br />
Coursework: Parallel implementation of a convolution filter (transform an image by applying  an effect such as blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge-detection, and more) on multiple remote computers, exploiting the memory hierarchy, optimize and evaluate their performance <br/>
Implementation: MPI, GPU and CUDA programming environment, Hybrid MPI and OpenMP, Gnuplot (for performance visualization)
